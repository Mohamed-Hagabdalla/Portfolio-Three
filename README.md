# Phone Shop

[View the live project here!](https://phone-shop-python.herokuapp.com/)

**Phone Shop** is a back end Python file, linked to a spreadsheet. The purpose of the Python file is to manipulate the spreadsheet, whenever necessary. The spreadsheet lists the number of phones, by phone type, sold by a shop over the course of a week. It also calculates the surplus and number of stock for each phone type. The sales, surplus and stock are seperated into 3 seperate worksheets, but they are all on one spreadsheet. Each column represents a market day in the week. The numbers in the sales worksheet represents the number of each phone type sold on each market day.

## Features

The user can use the program to manipulate the spreadsheet in any way they see fit. The user is prompted to input their values below the 'Enter your data here:'. This enables them to add data values to the relevant worksheet, which will add rows of data into the worksheet. The program will then perform the necessary calculations that will produce the new surplus.

## Testing

In order to ensure the program ran smoothly with the spreadsheet, it was tested by inputting random data values. In order for a test to be successful, the data values should be added as rows to the Sales worksheet and this will then result in a new row of calculated values in the Surplus worksheet.

## Validator Testing

To ensure the Python program ran smoothly and had no errors, it was tested for validation. Testing for the code and more information on how it was tested are explained below in more detail.

1. Python program 
-  Warning messages did occurr, in relation to indentation and whitespaces. However, no errors were found when running the Python code on the [PEP8 online check](http://pep8online.com/)


## Unfixed Bugs

One unfixed bug that occurred was the positioning of certain images used in the Gallery section. Some images were not presented as intended. This was due to the dimensions of the image not aligning well with other images.

## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. To successfully deploy a website, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure the relevant respository is loaded and select the settings tab.
2. Navigate to the pages tab (the second-last option on the left hand side).
3. Select the main branch, the root folder and click save.
4. Refresh the page and a message should appear, telling you that your site has been published.
5. The website has successfuly been deployed.
