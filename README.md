# Phone Shop

[View the live project here!](https://phone-shop-python.herokuapp.com/)

**Phone Shop** is a back end Python file, linked to a spreadsheet. The purpose of the Python file is to manipulate the spreadsheet, whenever necessary. The spreadsheet lists the number of phones, by phone type, sold by a shop over the course of a week. It also calculates the surplus and number of stock for each phone type. The sales, surplus and stock are seperated into 3 seperate worksheets, but they are all on one spreadsheet.

## Features

There are a few features that enhance the user's experience. For example, a navigation bar, club ethos, meet up times, images, sign up form and a footer.

### Navigation Bar

- This is located at the top right hand corner of each page.
- It is identical across the three pages, thus allowing for easy navigation across the different pages. Plus, they can access any page without having to go back everytime.
- Each navigation link is underlined when clicked, thus telling the user which webpage they are currently on.

### Footer

- This contains links to social media sites for **The GYM** that open in a new tab, so the user does not have to go back to the website everytime.
- Encourages the user to keep up to date with the latest news and offers.
- It is located at the bottom of every page, so the user can access them easily, regardless of which page they are currently on.

## Testing

The navigation bar on the top right hand corner of the website was tested to ensure each link navigated to the correct webpage. There were 3 links and each one navigates to a different page. Each link navigates to its intended page with no problems. The social media links, located at the bottom of each webpage, also navigate to their own sites with no issues.

## Validator Testing

To ensure the HTML and CSS codes ran smoothly and had no errors, they were both tested for validation. Testing for each code and more information on how they were tested are explained below in more detail.

1. HTML
-  A warning message did occurr, suggesting that headers should be included in the gallery section. However, no errors were found when running the HTML code on the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

2. CSS
- No errors were found when running the CSS code on the [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Unfixed Bugs

One unfixed bug that occurred was the positioning of certain images used in the Gallery section. Some images were not presented as intended. This was due to the dimensions of the image not aligning well with other images.

## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. To successfully deploy a website, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure the relevant respository is loaded and select the settings tab.
2. Navigate to the pages tab (the second-last option on the left hand side).
3. Select the main branch, the root folder and click save.
4. Refresh the page and a message should appear, telling you that your site has been published.
5. The website has successfuly been deployed.
